## Problem Domain

Teach us more about you! Build out an “About Me” webpage that quizzes the user on fun facts gives the user some basic information about who you are and where you came from. We will build onto this project over the next few labs. Be prepared to refactor your code each day and learn about how a web site incramentally goes from an idea to a deployed site through various iterations of development.
